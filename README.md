# browser-template

A template for starting front-end projects. Webpack for `require` system, build
pipeline, and development server. Boostrap and Handlebars.js included. No
front-end frameworks included.

## Installation

1. [Download](../../archive/master.zip) this template.
    - **Do Not Fork And Clone**
    - Click the "Clone or Download" button and select "Download Zip".
1. Move to the `wdi/projects` directory, then unzip the template directory with
    `unzip /Users/<user-name>/Downloads/browser-template-master.zip`.
1. Rename the template directory from `browser-template-master` to
    `<project-name>-client`.
1. Empty [`README.md`](README.md) and fill with your own content.
1. Replace all instances of `ga-wdi-boston.browser-template` with the name of
    your project.
    - You can search for all instances of text in Atom by pressing
    `commant + shift + f` on Mac or `ctrl + shift + f` on WSL.
1. Move into the new project and `git init`.
1. Add all of the files in your project with the command `git add --all`.
      - **Note: This is the only time you should run this command!**
1. Commit all of your files with the command `git commit`.
      - Your commit title should read `Initial commit`.
1. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
1. Create a new repository on [github.com](https://github.com),
    _not GitHub Enterprise_.
1. Name the new repository with the same name used on Step 3.
1. Follow the instructions on your new repository's setup page. For details on
   how to push to Github, refer to the section on Github entitled "…or push an existing
   repository from the command line." Further documentation can be found [here](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-an-existing-project-to-github-using-the-command-line/).

## Structure

### Scripts

Developers should store JavaScript files in [`assets/scripts`](assets/scripts).
The "manifest" or entry-point is
[`assets/scripts/app.js`](assets/scripts/app.js). In general, only
application initialization goes in this file. It's normal for developers to
start putting all code in this file, but encourage them to break out different
responsibilities and use the `require` syntax put references where they're
needed.

### Config

Developers should set `apiUrls.production` and `apiUrls.development` in
[`assets/scripts/config.js`](assets/scripts/config.js).  With
`apiUrls` set, developers may rely on `apiUrl` as the base for API
URLs.

### Styles

Developers should store styles in [`assets/styles`](assets/styles) and load them
from [`assets/styles/index.scss`](assets/styles/index.scss). Bootstrap version 3 is
included in this template.

### Forms and Using `getFormFields`

Developers should use [getFormFields](get-form-fields.md) to retrieve form data
to send to an API.

### Deployment

To deploy a browser-template based SPA, run `grunt deploy`.

## Adding Images

To add images to your project, you must store them in the `public` directory.
To use the image in HTML or CSS, write the path to the image like this:

```html
<img src="public/cat.jpg">
```
or
```css
#my-cool-div {
  background-image: url('public/cat.jpg')
}
```

Note that there's no `./` or `/` in front of `public/filename.jpg`.

## Adding Fonts

To add custom fonts to your app, you can either use a CDN like Google Fonts, or
you can download the fonts and save them in the `public` directory. If you use
the former method, follow the directions on the website providing the fonts.

For local fonts, put the files in `public`, and then import and use them in a
`.scss` file like this:

```scss
@font-face {
  font-family: 'Nature Beauty';
  src: url('public/Nature-Beauty.ttf') format('truetype');
}

.element-with-custom-font {
  font-family: 'Nature Beauty';
}
```

## Tasks

Developers should run these often!

- `grunt nag` or just `grunt`: runs code quality analysis tools on your code
    and complains
- `grunt make-standard`: reformats all your code in the JavaScript Standard Style
- `grunt <server|serve|s>`: generates bundles, watches, and livereloads
- `grunt build`: place bundled styles and scripts where `index.html` can find
    them
- `grunt deploy`: builds and deploys master branch
